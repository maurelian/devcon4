## Preparation

Here's how to get set up for the workshop. It should be super easy except if you're using Windows.

First, you need a web3 capable browser and some testnet ETH. You probably also have both, but if not, get [Metamask](https://metamask.io) and grab some ETH from the Ropsten faucets:

- https://faucet.metamask.io/
- https://faucet.ropsten.be/

The workshop exercises are hosted in an separate repo. Get a local copy by cloning the repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ConsenSys/devcon4-playground/
```

### Installing Security Tools from the Future

In this workshop you'll get a sneak peek into the future: We'll be using Mythril Platform prototypes we built together with the [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com) and [Guardrails](https://www.guardrails.io) guys, as well as the latest build of [Mythril Classic](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril-classic), which was we created just in time for DevCon4 under extreme stress (in most countries such work conditions would be illegal, that's why so many of our devs live in South East Asia).

If you run into insurmountable problems ask the instructors for help. There's also a dedicated [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/kGDd8FP) that we created exclusively for you, the valued workshop participant. Some of
our core devs will be on standby to fix bugs in realtime.

**Note that this is all super-experimental stuff! The [Mythril Platform](https://mythril.ai) beta isn't even starting before December. Monitor the #announcements channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/kktn8Wt) for updates.**

#### Truffle 5 Prototype

[Truffle Suite](https://truffleframework.com) is a popular development framework for Ethereum. For this workshop we'll install a prototype with Mythril Platform integration. Run the following command to install it:

```
$ npm install -g truffle-plus-analyze
$ truffle+analyze --help
Truffle+Analyze v5.0.0-beta.1f - a development framework for Ethereum

Usage: truffle+analyze <command> [options]

Commands:
(...)
  analyze   Run Mythril Platform analyses on a contract
(...)
```

Don't worry if you already have Truffle installed - installing the experimental build will not affect your existing installation. You'll get a separate binary called `truffle+analyze` that you uninstall later without breaking anything.

You'll also need a [Mythril Platform](https://mythril.ai) alpha key to use the `truffle analyze` command. In this workshop we'll use a shared temporary API key. To set it up, change into the devcon4-playground directory and run the setup script:

```
$ cd devcon4-playground
$ source mythril-staging
Set up to use Mythril staging
```

Note that this API key will only work for a couple of days as we'll be switching to JWT auth shortly. The official beta launch is still a few weeks away, but you can always touch base with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/VfTbCm4) if you want access.

#### GuardRails Alpha

[Guardrails](https://www.guardrails.io) is a Github app that hooks into the development workflow and reports security issues on pull requests. To try out Guardrails, fork the [devcon4-playground repository](https://github.com/ConsenSys/devcon4-playground/) using the "Fork" button on the top right. Then, install the [Guardrails Github app](https://github.com/apps/guardrails) and point it to your copy of the devcon4-playground (we'll go through this process in the workshop).

#### Mythril Classic

[Mythril Classic](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril-classic) is a command-line tool for advanced users. It can do a *lot* of stuff, such as analyzing contracts on the blockchain, creating control flow graphs, searching the Ethereum state trie and auto-generating transaction sequences to trigger bugs (plus you can use it to cheat in CTFs).

You can install the latest version from Pypi or Dockerhub (instructions in the [Mythril Classic Wiki](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril-classic/wiki/Installation-and-Setup). Make sure you have version 0.19.3 installed.

Mythril uses solc to compile Solidity files, so you'll need to [install that as well](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#binary-packages).

**Installing from Pypi**

```
$ pip3 install mythril
$ myth --version
Mythril version v0.19.3
```

**Installing from DockerHub**

```
$ docker pull mythril/myth
$ docker run mythril/myth --version
Mythril version v0.19.3
```

## Part 1 - The Smart Contract Secure SDLC

In part 1, [Tom Lindeman](https://twitter.com/EtherDotBlue) explains secure SDLC processes. He's not a coder like the rest of us, so please be gentle and don't ask him any hard technical questions.

TL;DR: Security should be incorporated during all phases of development. This info graphic sums things up nicely:

## Part 2 - Threat Modeling

Before and during buidling a smart contract system you should think about potential threats and countermeasures. This process is known as threat modeling. In part 2, [Gerhard Wagner](https://twitter.com/g3rh4rdw4gn3r) introduces threat modeling basics. Here's the workshop material:

- [Presentation slides](slides/How_to_Not_Get_Rekt_Volume_1_Threat_Modeling.pdf)
- [Blockchain incident threat list](threat-modeling/threat_list_blockchain_incident_db.md)

**Threat Modeling Exercise:**

After all this theory it's time for some hands-on action. Pick one of the following options:

- [Build a threat model for your own smart contract system](threat-modeling/exercise_your_own_system.md)
- [Build a threat model for Crypto Froggies](threat-modeling/exercise_sample_system.md)

## Part 3 - The Real Fun Begins

For the remainder of the workshop we'll be looking at different ways of identifying, fixing, exploiting and preventing vulnerabilities during development.

### Exercise 1 - Truffle Analyze

In [exercise 1](https://github.com/ConsenSys/devcon4-playground/tree/master/exercise1) we'll give a sneak peek of the `truffle analyze` command, an upcoming feature of [Truffle Suite](https://truffleframework.com). Let's see if Truffle can spot the security bug and think about ways to fix it.

To run `truffle analyze`, first change into the project directory for exercise 1. Note that you need to compile the code before running the `truffle analyze` command. 

```
$ cd devcon4-playground/exercise1
$ truffle+analyze compile
$ truffle+analyze analyze --timeout 60
```

If you get an error message saying "You need to set environment variable MYTHRIL_API_KEY to run analyze", re-run the setup script which as described above.

The results you get from `truffle analyze` should look similar to this:

```
0:0   error  Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested with  SWC-103                                        
20:4  error  The arithmetic operation can result in integer overflow   SWC-101                                                                                          
(...)
```

Note the "SWC" identifier at the end: That's a reference to the [Smart Contract Weakness Classification (EIP 1470)](https://smartcontractsecurity.github.io/SWC-registry/). You can look up details about each issue there.

Now things will get serious! We'll take the attacker's side and exploit a similar vulnerability on [CaptureTheEther](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/math/token-sale/).

### Exercise 2 - Cheating on CTFs with Mythril Classic

Mythril Classic has a few extra tricks up its sleeve. In the [second exercise](https://github.com/ConsenSys/devcon4-playground/tree/master/exercise2), we'll look at the `Tokensale` contract from [CaptureTheEther](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/math/token-whale/). The source code of that contract is in the `exercise2` directory. 

The question is, does it have any vulnerabilities? Let's do a quick Mythril Classic run to find out:

```
$ myth -x exercise2/contracts/Tokensale.sol
```

Looks like another integer-related bug! Let's now think about how to best exploit this issue. What we want is to get a lot of tokens without paying a single ETH. A nice trick is to express the exact opposite of what we want as an *invariant* using an `assert()` statement and letting Mythril do the work of finding the solution.

Create a copy of `Tokensale.sol` called `Tokensale-cheat.sol` and add an assertion to the function `buy` as follows:

```
    function buy(uint256 numTokens) public payable {

        require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);

        assert(!(msg.value == 0 && numTokens > 0));
```

This essentially means "it should never happen that numTokens is greater than zero if msg.value (the amount of Ether sent) is zero". Obviously, as the attacker that's precisely what we *want* to happen. By adding the `--verbose-report` flag, Mythril will give you the transaction data needed to violate the assertion.

```
$ myth -mexceptions -x exercise2/contracts/Tokensale-cheat.sol --verbose-report
```

Can you tell why "calldata" in Mythril's output has that particular value?

### Exercise 3 - Continuous Integration with Github Projects

To ensure that no bugs make it into the code it's useful to integrate security analysis into the deployment pipeline. In [exercise 3](https://github.com/ConsenSys/devcon4-playground/tree/master/exercise3), we'll try the [Guardrails](https://www.guardrails.io) Github app, which should detect a couple of security issues. After brainstorming possible fixes for the issue(s), we'll then proceed to exploit them to steal testnet ETH from the [CaptureTheEther Bank](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/miscellaneous/token-bank/). Note: Never steal ETH from a real smart contract as this is generally frowned upon.

### Exercise 4 - Hacking Contracts on the Mainnet

Mythril Classic can analyze smart contracts from many sources, including bytecode on the blockchain. In [exercise 4](https://github.com/ConsenSys/devcon4-playground/tree/master/exercise4), we'll identify another type of vulnerability that has often been exploited in the past. We'll then show how to detect vulnerable contracts on the mainnet and auto-generate an exploit that extracts the kills the vulnerable contract.

An important aspect is the number of transactions that Mythril (symbolically) executes. The default number is 1, but you can increase it for a more in-depth analysis (note that this increases analysis time significantly). By setting max transactions to 2, you will also detect bugs that are two transactions "deep".

For this example, let's set the max transaction count to 2:

```
$ myth -x exercise4/contracts/Ownable.sol --max-transaction-count 2 --verbose-report
```

Again, the `--verbose-report` will give you the transaction sequence for triggering the bug - take a good look at the output!

Now the real fun starts: We'll deploy a real-world contract instance with a similar vulnerability. Whoever exploits it first is not only awesome, but also wins 0.1337 ETH for buying Pizza (or hodl).

Tip: You can run Mythril Classic against an on-chain contract using the `-a` flag.

### Exercise 5 - Verifying Invariants Using Asserts

The Solidity `assert()` statement is used to specify conditions that are expected to *always* hold. If you want to prove certain assumptions about your code, you can put them into asserts and use Mythril's symbolic execution engine to do all the hard work for you.

Mythril Classic will detect reachable exceptions by default. To *only* search for exceptions, add the `-mexceptions` option.

```bash
$ myth -mexceptions -x <Solidity file>
```

In [exercise 5](https://github.com/ConsenSys/devcon4-playground/tree/master/exercise5), we'll write a test to (dis-)prove an invariant in a [token contract](https://github.com/ConsenSys/devcon4-playground/blob/master/exercise5/token-with-backdoor.sol). The token code sample was shown by Josselin Feist on TruffleCon 2018 (shouts to our friends from [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com)).

The invariant we want to verify is that a user's balance can never exceed 1,000. A nice way to do this is to create a separate test contract that inherits from the contract to be tested. Create a new file named `token-with-backdoor-test.sol` in the `exercise5` directory and add a function containing the assertion that balances[msg.sender] must never exceed 1,000:

```solidity
import "./token-with-backdoor.sol";

contract TokenTest is Token {

    // Verify that the user's balance can never exceed 1000
    
    function verify_balance() {
        assert(balances[msg.sender] <= 1000);
    }
 
}
```

Now we should be ready to go! Run Mythril Classic against the newly created file:

```bash
$ myth -mexceptions -x exercise5/token-with-backdoor-test.sol --max-transaction-count 3 --verbose-report
```

As you can see, in this case three transactions need to be sent in the correct order to violate the invariant. Again, it is useful to have a close look at Mythril's output and match it to the functions in the contract.
